# Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers and guests at our events are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Organisers of React Knowledgeable [Wei Gao](https://github.com/wgao19), [Ken Lee](https://github.com/KenLSM) and [Jennie Ji](https://github.com/jennieji) will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any event, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup, and the group, at the discretion of the organisers.

As a courtesy to @Shopee, hiring remarks are not welcome.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff immediately.

As a courtesy to @Shopee, hiring remarks are not welcome.

Our staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all venues and social events.
